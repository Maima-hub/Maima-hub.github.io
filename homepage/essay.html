<h2 class="text-white"> Make it to the Empire State</h2>
<div class= "text-white"> Essay

<div class= Essay2>
 <p>The Empire State. A name that exudes wealth and opulence which has been the reputation of this great city for centuries. The way that I understood the prestige associated with this city was it was the true manifestation of the nation’s notoriety for being “the land of opportunity”. As Jay-Z said himself, “If I can make it here, I can make it anywhere”. NYC is the true land of hope. However, as I became more familiar with the transplants in the city, I began to learn more about how those who did not grow up here view our city. I met some of my sisters' college friends at NYU and was amazed at how they viewed the city. Their idea of the city consisted of the museums, galleries, wall street bankers on fancy hotel rooftops, etc. They were the consumers of the fruits of the labor of the city's natives so much so that their whole notion of the city was rooted in consumerism. 
</p>
  <p>The contrast between those who wish to be a part of the empire and those who helped build the empire that lies in the pit of our memories. My idea of NYC is rooted in the camaraderie shared between homegrown New Yorkers regardless of their background. Our shared experiences are like those found nowhere else. Whether it’s seeing a fight on your subway cart on your morning commute or accidentally stepping on your local bodega cat, these little moments connect the inhabitants of this city in our individual quests to make it in the empire state. 
</p>
<p>Meeting my sister's  transfer student friends tainted my idea of the city, seeing that so many people have their own idea of what this place means to them. Kai, a friend of my sisters who is an international Japanese student, came to New York for the first time in his Fendi light brown silk shantung coat and his Dior suede shoes expecting  to come to the New York that was seen as a city made famous by Hollywood movies. Instead, he saw brownstone houses on every block and vintage thrift shops that no one knew the name to. He asked my sister for a tour around the area and we showed him around our neighborhood in Brooklyn, Church Avenue. I remember when we got out of the station, he asked, “ is this a part of Manhattan or no?”. 
</p>
<p> We passed by our local gas station bodega called “Bolla Market”.  With the crooked, big green sign, rusty doors, and the smell of gasoline, I could tell Kai was not having The Big Apple experience that he was expecting, but we wanted to show him an authentic day in our lives. As we walked in through the door, Balal, a Bangladehsi worker who has been the manager of the store for 5 years, welcomed us with “hello!, ki kobar” which in bengali means hi, how are you? We smiled back and said “balo” (good). When we went to pay for our  big bag of honey barbeque chips and our beverages, Balal looked at Kai and said “very nice jacket” and started laughing. He then proceeded with “you new?” and then went on with telling him of the history of the store. He started off with his classic, the gunman, “oh, oh one time I was back here, when a big man, big jacket came to the store, yeah, I saw he had a gun in his back pocket of his cacky jeans. I was so scared, I called 911 as soon as he left and closed the store for the day. I still remember what he bought, mango aloe vera drink with a raisin cookie.” Kai awkwardly stood and just nodded his head, circling his head around the store “touring”.
</p>
<p> Balal always makes an effort to make anyones day with a simple joke or compliment. There were times however when Balal was not always in the mood for work, and talking to his customers was a way of coping with his feelings. My dad was filling up gas one day while I was  in the store picking up some snacks. After purchasing my items, I lingered around because my dad was not done with the car. I could tell that, that day Balal was feeling a lack of excitement and joy. He began to tell me a story of how hard it was for him in finding a job in America. Saving up for two years he came to the United States with eight hundred dollars and a plan. He would become a registered nurse, send money home until he could sponsor his family, and bring them to New York. He spoke no english, had no friends, and spent almost all his time studying for his nursing exams which he failed to pass. After many retakes, he finally passed and was a nurse for a couple years when he decided to quit, and run the market instead. I did not know exactly what made him decide to quit but I do know it was for the better. The days he worked  extra hours, or closed the store a little later, gave free Arizona drinks to kids, made sandwiches even after the grill closed, made meals for the homeless, those were the moments that made him love his job regardless if he was a nurse or not. 
</p>
<p> So much of Brooklyn has changed yet Balal has managed to keep Bolla Market the way it always was. Church Avenue was known for its predominantly South Asian population, its food, shops, vendors, and dirty sidewalks. Over the past couple of years, gentrification has changed a lot of Church Ave . Prices have risen and the traditions have overall changed.  When entering a Dunkin Donuts, the workers would always greet their customers by saying assalamualaikum (in arabic means hello). Once the population  changed, they started  to act more Americanized and instead say “hello, how are you doing?”  they even changed their staff members so that new people would feel more comfortable. It felt as if their main goal was to satisfy the new population, which would only come into the store like once a month. More and more grocery shops went under renovation after 15 years, and vendors started closing down. Regardless of the population change/gentrification, Bolla Market has not ever changed the way they treat their customers or the way they run the store. They have always been transparent about their culture/religion without feeling ashamed, or the fear of bad customer reviews. They knew that no matter what,  people would still respect the culture and vibe of the store. A customer came to Bolla Market once, when I went to pick up an iced coffee and questioned Balal about  the little blue elephant statue that was placed on top of the cashier, facing the customers. Balal felt a rush of adrenaline because he always loves to answer questions. He started off by saying how it was a statue of Ganesha, one of his gods that represents the remover of obstacles, and how sometimes working 24 hour shifts made it hard for him to pray, so having the statue made him feel at home.  It was his second home. There were days that were much harder than others, and made him rethink his decisions, but Ganesha reminded him that life was an obstacle.   
</p>
<p> The warmth and comfort that customers feel when walking into Bollar Market is what makes the little store successful, not the selection of chocolate bars, or amount of takis stocked up,  but the experience that we have stepping foot into the place. The fact that when Balal’s kids ask him how work was, he gets to tell them about the friends he made, and the laughs he had.
